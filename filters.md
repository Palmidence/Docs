**Filters** are allow/deny conditions about players, blocks, or the match in general, used in conjunction with regions. 
Other modules use filters to decide if and when things should happen to players, blocks, or the entire match.

- `enter` - Condition that is answered with `allow` or `deny` to know if a player should be able to enter a region or not.

- `build` - Condition that is answered with `allow` or `deny` to know if a player should be able to build in a region or not.

- `block-explode` - Condition that is answered with `allow` or `deny` to know if explosives should protect a region or not.
