The [Warzone Network](https://warz.one/ "Warzone Website") is a server consisting of a series of objective-based gamemodes. They develop their own plugin, *[TGM](https://github.com/WarzoneMC/Warzone)* which is open sourced and free for anyone to use. Continuing on with this wiki will be the basics of the different modules in the plugin which allows the maps in TGM to be used and played.

**JSON**, or more specifically *JavaScript Object Notation* is the backend on how maps are "coded" into TGM. Basically, it's an easy-to-read document that tells the plugin exactly where the spawns and monuments/capture points are all located in the map, etc.

If you ever heard of the more popular project *[PGM](https://github.com/OvercastNetwork/ProjectAres)*, you may also know that they use XML instead of JSON which is similar but different in quite a bit of ways.

There's multiple advantages that JSON has over XML, 2 main points being:
- It's much shorter in length
- It's quicker for the server to read and write
