**Monuments** are a tangible objective that yields a win condition once broken.

`monuments:` is the parent. Monument properties are specified underneath.

- `name:` is what the monument will display as on the scoreboard.

- `region:` refers to a region in which the monument is to be registered as an objective.

- `teams:` specifies the teams that are allowed by the server to break the monument.

- `health:` specifies the amount of blocks off of the region must be broken.

>**Example:** `health: 7` would mean that 7 blocks would need to be broken to win.

This is used for the **DTM** and **DTW** gamemodes.
